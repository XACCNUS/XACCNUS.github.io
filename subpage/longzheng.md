# A High-Performance Graph Processing Accelerator


## Abstract:
Graph processing has been widely-used in many real-world scenarios.
It is notoriously challenging to accelerate graph processing
applications due to its well-known random memory access patterns.
In this talk, I will introduce an ambitious project in China for
building a graph processing computer, funded by the National Key
Research and Development Program of China. We characterize some
typical memory behaviors of graph processing, and rethink their
architectural designs for improving memory-efficient parallelism,
particularly in terms of edge parallelization. I will also introduce
some industrial user cases, such as financial anti-fraud application
from Ping An Technology Co. LTD, and Power and state estimation from
State Grid Co. of China. Our graph accelerator can boost their
performance significantly.
